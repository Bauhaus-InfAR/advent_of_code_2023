# Advent of code 2023

Join the fun and add your solutions to this year's [Advent of code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Simply add a file in your preferred language in the matching day's folder using your name as file name.

As a general rule, _**try to avoid Jupyter notebooks**_ as they don't play that great with Git. Also, if you're using a compiled language, first of all, good on you and, second, _**only add source files**_, not compiled programs.

Happy coding! :relaxed:
